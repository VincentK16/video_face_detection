# Face Detection in images

Face Detection in 10 lines of code using OpenCV and Python.

The code in this folder can be directly used on image files for face detection. It can detect any number of faces but might 
require the source image to be resized if it is too big and flows out of memory.

Check the Python source file for face-detection in videos for detailed comments on logic and libraries.
