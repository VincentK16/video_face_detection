	#considers more features for the detection of faces
	#Starting off with simpler classifiers it increasingly uses them in combination 
	#for subsequent steps if the prior steps yield positive results

	#This file must be available for the purpose of classification

		#This is the crux of the program where discretionary parameters can be set for better results
		
		#The Scalefactor decides how many iterations the Classifier will perform in its seach for images. 
		#In every iteration, the Classifier looks for a bigger face size, starting from small and going up
		#until it is checking the entire size of the frame. The scaleFactor decides this step size. 
		#Smaller the scaleFactor, more sensitive the Classifier and longer it takes to process the frame
		
		#The minNeighbors decides the Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it.
		#Greater the minNeighbors, greater the sensitivity. However, higher might lead to false positives.
